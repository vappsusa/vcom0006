## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### The Four Golden Rules

1. **Page Routes** (`/l/*`, `/i/*`, `/o/*`) = SEO HTML with structured data (indexed by Google)
2. **API Routes** (`/api/*`) = JSON data processing with AI (NOT indexed)
3. **AI Pipeline** = Vercel AI SDK + AI Gateway (85% cache, $0.000268/question)
4. **Deployment** = Application-Aware Routing (zero-downtime, instant rollbacks)
